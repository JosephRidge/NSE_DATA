# Summary:
This compilation of historical daily stock market price data relates to the Kenyan Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) for whole of year 2021.  This data is valuable for any machine learning algorithm that needs data (training, validation, testing).  This compilation develops on an earlier dataset (2008-2012) that was initially compiled as part of a research project to predict next day stock price, based on the previous five days, using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). This initial research [1],[2] tested 6 stocks [3] using ANN of configuration 5:21:21:1. The data was then enhanced as a new compilation of all stocks in the period 2007-2012 [4].


### Features in Data: 
- **12m High:** This typically refers to the highest price level at which a security (such as a stock or a commodity) has traded within the last 12 months. It's often used as a reference point to gauge the recent performance of the security. Investors may look at the 12-month high to assess how close the current price is to its highest level over the past year.

- **Day Low:** This refers to the lowest price level at which a security has traded during a particular trading day. It indicates the minimum price that investors were willing to buy the security for during that day's trading session.

- **Day High:** This refers to the highest price level at which a security has traded during a particular trading day. It indicates the maximum price that investors were willing to pay for the security during that day's trading session.

- **Day Price:** This term isn't as commonly used, but it could refer to the price of a security at a particular point during the trading day. It could be the opening price, the closing price, or the price at any other specific time during the trading session. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine precisely what "Day Price" refers to

- **Previous:** This refers to the price or value of a security (such as a stock) at the end of the previous trading session. It provides a reference point for comparing the current price or value of the security.

- **Change:** This represents the absolute difference between the current price or value of a security and its previous price or value. It shows how much the price has moved up or down since the last trading session.

- **Change%:** This represents the percentage change in the price or value of a security from its previous price or value. It's calculated by dividing the absolute change by the previous price or value and multiplying by 100. This percentage change provides a standardized way to compare price movements across different securities.

- **Volume:** This refers to the total number of shares or contracts traded for a particular security during a specific period, usually a trading day. It indicates the level of activity or liquidity in the market for that security. Higher volume often suggests greater interest in the security and can influence its price movement.

- **Adjust:** This term could have different meanings depending on the context. One common interpretation is "adjusted" prices, which are prices that have been modified to account for corporate actions such as dividends, stock splits, or other events that affect the price of the security. Adjusted prices are often used to provide a more accurate historical picture of a security's performance, especially when comparing it over time.
